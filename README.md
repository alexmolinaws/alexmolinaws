# :wave: Hello! I'm Alexis.

I know, my name is kind of common yet I'm not an average developer.

I'm a fan of e-learning, FOSS, and the evolution of Internet, which is why I develop websites and applications, bringing great user interfaces to life that run clean, efficient code under the hood. That's a profile I've been sharpening for over 6 years :muscle: working for clients all around the globe :earth_americas: from WordPress sites to full-stack applications. 

### _"Trust over trends"_ is my stack

The stack I build web applications with, consist of some of the most stablished, versatile and consistent technologies in the Industry:

### _"Wait, how's that not average?"_

Well, I've been in charge of the wireframing, UX/UI design, development, deployment and maintenance for most of those projects, delivering the final product in a timely manner. I speak English, Spanish and also Portuguese, while being probably the most open-minded person you'd ever talk to. All that just boosts my communication and sales :grin:.


### My toolbox is always growing

I keep my workflow simple yet powerful thanks to robust software I use, on a daily basis, to do magic with no excuses:

## Nobody's perfect though

I'm a competitive perfectionist, constantly looking for ways to improve :sweat_smile: and that can be annoying for some (if not for you tho, check my links below). Another con is that I'm too professional for debating on politics or cult films at work, I'd rather provide advice regarding software instead (if you still don't mind all that, check below those links I already mentioned :wink:).
