# :wave: Hello! I'm Alex Molina.

Yeh I know, my name is kind of regular yet I'm not an average developer.

I'm a fan of e-learning, FOSS, and the evolution of Internet, which is why I develop websites and applications, bringing great user interfaces to life that run clean, efficient code under the hood. That's a profile I've been sharpening for over 6 years :muscle: working for clients all around the globe :earth_americas: from WordPress sites to online stores. 

### _"Wait, how's that not average?"_

Well, I've been in charge of the wireframing, UX/UI design, development, deployment and maintenance for most of those projects, delivering the final product and assessment in a timely manner. I speak English, Spanish and Portuguese, and also be probably the most open-minded person you'd talk to. All that just boosts my communication and sales :grin:.

## Nobody's perfect though

I'm a competitive perfectionist, constantly looking for ways to improve :sweat_smile: and that can be annoying for some (if not for you tho, check my links below). Another con is that I'm too professional for debating on politics or cult films at work, but I can provide advice regarding the software instead (a reason why others say my software architecture operations are "too objective" :pencil:). If you still don't mind all that, check below those links I already mentioned :wink:.

### _"Trust over trends"_ is my stack

The stack I build web applications with, consist of some of the most stablished, versatile and consistent technologies in the Industry:
